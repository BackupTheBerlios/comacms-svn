This is the top of the ComaCMS repository.

  trunk/    The latest development sources. Usualy we work
            on this tree.

  branches/ Various development branches. Typically a branch
            contains a complete copy of trunk/, even if the
            changes are isolated to one subdirectory.  Note
            that branch copies are generally removed after
            they've been merged back into trunk, so what's in
            branches/ now does not reflect all the branches
            that have ever been created.

  tags/     Snapshots of releases and milestones.
